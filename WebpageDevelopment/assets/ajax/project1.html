        <div class="cbp-l-inline-subtitle">Sections: BBMC & CCAN</div>

        <div class="cbp-l-inline-desc">BBMC, in partnership with <a href="https://www.oumedicine.com/pediatrics/department-sections/developmental-behavioral-pediatrics/center-on-child-abuse-and-neglect">OUHSC's Center on Child Abuse and Neglect,</a> is evaluating the effectiveness of a newly implemented Oklahoma Department of Human Services <a href="okdhs.org">(OKDHS)</a> service system called Intensive Safety Services (ISS). This new program aims to prevent the removal of children from families who are believed to be at moderate risk for future or continued child maltreatment by involving caregivers in intensive wrap-around services early in the secondary prevention process. The demonstration project focuses on accomplishing improved outcomes for families, improving safety and well-being of children, and preventing child abuse and neglect, and re-entry of children into the child welfare system.</p>
						<p>This evaluation involves three sub-studies: 1) a process study to evaluate the quality of service implementation, 2) an outcomes study to evaluate the effectiveness of the new system relative to the prior system in terms of child safety, permanency, and well-being, and 3) a cost study to determine cost-effectiveness and potential cost savings of the new ISS program.The waiver demonstration project allows DHS to provide ISS in the home to families who, previously, would have experienced a child removal. The intent is that this immediate, focused service will allow select families to remain together, and thereby, address the drastic increase of the number of children in care. </p></div>
