        <div class="cbp-l-inline-desc">BBMC is partnering with OU College of Medicine, Oklahoma Shared Clinical and Translational Resources (<a href="http://osctr.ouhsc.edu/">OSCTR</a>), 
                OU Physicians, and the Health Care Authority/Meditech on the creation of a clinical data
                warehouse (<a href="clinical data warehouse">CDW</a>). The development of CDW aims to connect 
                electronic medical records (<a href="http://healthit.ahrq.gov/key-topics/electronic-medical-record-systems">EMR</a>s) to research and QI/QA
                communities. This will improve OUHSC's ability to compete for grants and care for patients. It will also allow facilitation of 
                meaningful local surveillance programs. CDW will also help avoid undesireable work-arounds which create risk
                for duplicate data entry, poorer data quality, and poorly managed mini-databases.</div>
