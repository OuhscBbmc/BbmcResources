        <div class="cbp-l-inline-desc">OUHSC is conducting an external evaluation of the OK State Competitive MIECHV grant. We refer to this project as "Giving Parents a Voice" since we are reaching out to 
                families asking how best to service their unique needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is a mixed-methods project with extensive quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis. The quantitative portion involves a longitudinal survey with families in five targeted counties. The data collected from this survey address all MIECHV benchmarks, ACEs, and service utilization. This data will act as a comparison group for Evidence-Based Home Visiting clients. The qualitative portion of the study involves semi-structured one-on-one interviews with Evidence-Based Home Visiting providers, administrators, and legislators, as well as focus
                groups involving families eligible for these services.
              </p>

                The MIECHV Expansion project includes another community survey targeted at EBHV clients, as well as a pilot EEG study with Dr. Lauren Ethridge, director of University of Oklahoma's <a href="/babl/index.html">Brain and Biomarker Laboratory.</a> For the pilot study, EBHV-eligible children and caregivers will be administered an EEG. This study aims to evaluate how families with different risk factors react to emotional stimuli.
