        <div class="cbp-l-inline-desc">BBMC also sponsors the <a href="https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/StatisticalComputing">Statistical Computing Users Group</a> or SCUG. 
                "Our goal is to facilitate the use of statistical and methodological tools and promote collaboration, mentorship,
                and discussion of research and analysis."
              </p>
              <p>
                The group meets the first Tuesday of the month in the Samis Education Center in OU Children's Hospital (please scroll down to the bottom of the
                <a href="https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/StatisticalComputing">site</a> for more scheduling details).
                The group is open to anyone interested in the tools used by statisticians and research methodologists. We encourage any students or employees 
                to participate or present. Alternatively, if there's a technique that would help your research
                or assignments, we'll try to arrange an expert to teach us about it.
