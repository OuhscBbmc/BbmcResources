    Hi zzz, we use REDCap (https://projectredcap.org/) to contain PHI data securely.

    Will you please log into the BBMC’s REDCap instance at https://bbmc.ouhsc.edu?  This will initialize your account on the server. Please tell me when you’ve done this, so I can add you to the appropriate REDCap project(s).  You’ll receive an automated email from REDCap for each project your authorized to use.
