* **email body**:

    Hi zzz, in this upcoming project, we allow access only to authorized employees.  For *each person* that the IRB has approved to access the project's PHI could you please tell us: (a) their name and (b) OUHSC username?  

    Ideally all the names are contained in a single email.  If you need to add a name later, plese resend the enitre list.  Also, please email us if someone leaves OUHSC, or otherwise stops involvement in the project; we need to remove their access to assets like the (a) fileserver space, (b) REDCap projects, and (c) GitHub repository.
