# Fileserver Tasks

### Confirm collaborators exact OUHSC user names


* **email to**: {collaborators}

* **email cc**: Zabrina Antry; David Bard; Sreeharsha Mandem

* **email subject**: CDW {project-name}: What are the OUHSC usernames of your team?

* **email body**:

    Hi zzz, in this upcoming project, we allow access only to authorized employees.  For *each person* that the IRB has approved to access the project's PHI, could you please tell us: (a) their name, (b) their OUHSC username, and (c) their email address?  

    Ideally all the names are contained in a single email.  If you need to add a name later, please resend the entire list.  Also, please email us if someone leaves OUHSC, or otherwise stops involvement in the project; we need to remove their access to assets like the (a) fileserver space, (b) REDCap projects, and (c) GitHub repository.
