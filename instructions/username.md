# Fileserver Tasks

### Confirm collaborators exact OUHSC user names


* **email to**: {collaborators}

* **email cc**: Geneva Marshall; Ashley Thumann; David Bard; Sreeharsha Mandem; Will  Beasley

* **email subject**: CDW [{project-name}]: What are the OUHSC usernames of your team? (email 1 of 3)

* **email body**:

    Hi zzz, in this upcoming project, we allow access only to authorized employees.  For *each person* that the IRB has approved to access the project's PHI, could you please tell us: (a) their name, (b) their OUHSC username, and (c) their email address?  

    Ideally all the names are contained in a single email.  If you need to add a name later, please resend the entire list.  Also, please email us if someone leaves OUHSC, or otherwise stops involvement in the project; we need to remove their access to assets like the (a) fileserver space, (b) REDCap projects, and (c) GitHub repository.

    Once you’re authorized on the file server space, you should have full rights to space.  Please contact Geneva or Ashley if you’d like to map it to your local machine as `S:\BBMC\{project-name}`.
