    Hi zzz, we use GitHub (https://github.com) to manage a lot of the BBMC assignments, code, and aggregated/de-identified reports.  To be clear, no data or PHI gets on GitHub (or ever leaves IT-approved storage devices, like file servers or databases).

    I created a private repo for the upcoming reporting projects that we hope to work with you on.  Could you please:

    1. Create a free GitHub user account at https://github.com/.  (Instructions are at https://github.com/join.)
    2. Ideally your profile has your name and institution.  (That way, we're not worried about selecting the wrong “Will Beasley” when I’m choosing between “wibeasley”, “wbeasley”, or “wibeasley2001”.
    3. Turn on “Two-Factor Authentication”. (This adds an extra layer of security.  Instructions are at https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication/.)
    4. Email us your GitHub username.  We'll add you as an official collaborator on a specific GitHub repository.
    5. You'll get an email to confirm that you'd like to join the new repository.
    6. Once you're added, you'll be able to access the repo at https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/{project-name}.  Until you're added, you (like the rest of the public) will be blocked, and see only a 404 error page.

    At first, you're likely to be a consumer of the contents and reports on the repository.  If you'd like to add material to the repo, please talk to us first.  We have some guidelines and practices for avoiding PHI inadvertently getting onto the repository.
