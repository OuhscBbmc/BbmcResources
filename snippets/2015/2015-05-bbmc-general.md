The **Biomedical and Behavioral Methodology Core (BBMC)** of the Department of Pediatrics, OUMC, is a shared resource that currently consists of three primary and two jointly-appointed faculty members, 4 academic support staff and 1 administrative support staff.  The BBMC mission is to support and enhance study design, data capture, and analytics for biomedical and behavioral research, and this Core currently provides a variety of methods support for several ongoing clinical and translational research studies in the Department of Pediatrics as well as several other outside Departments and Colleges across both the Norman and OKC campuses.  BBMC faculty represent established federally funded scientific researchers with biostatistics and informatics expertise and extensive publication records.  BBMC faculty and staff offer specialized methods expertise in Bayesian methods, clinical trials, field trials and survey research, study design and management, measurement and psychometrics, analysis of complex sampling designs, generalized linear modeling, generalized latent variable modeling, longitudinal and spatial analysis, time series and dynamic modeling, quantitative genetics, population genetics, computational programming and statistics, software development, database design and management, and bioinformatics.  Faculty and staff participate in both independent and collaborative research, provide general research consultation, teach and mentor graduate and undergraduate students, and supervise research assistants at all levels of academic and non-academic rank.  The Core has strong, active partnerships or roles within the University IT Departments, the Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, the Oklahoma Shared Clinical and Translational Resources (OSCTR) Center, and the OU Supercomputing Center for Education & Research (OSCER).
