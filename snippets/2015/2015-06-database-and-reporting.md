### Written for Trish and her DHS RFI by Will

We have expertise across a spectrum of data collection and storage approaches that accommodate most needs in behavioral research.  We typically develop a REDCap database for participant-focused longitudinal investigations, particularly when many authorized users need to interact with sensitive information off-campus (REDCap is a HIPAA-compliant system original designed for clinical research; project-redcap.org).  We frequently couple REDCap with a relational enterprise database server (such as SQL Server or MySQL) when a hierarchical structure exists between multiple collection instruments.  We submit our projects to the campus security team for initial approval and subsequent annual reviews.  Communication between statistical software and the two systems is facilitated by REDCapR –a software package we’ve developed in R (github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR).  Finally, analytical reports are distributed to interested parties through static and interactive reports (eg, ouhscbbmc.github.io/MReportingPublic, shiny.ouhsc.edu/TfcbtPublic/Shiny/TherapistProgress, shiny.ouhsc.edu/MReportingPublic/Shiny/C1).
