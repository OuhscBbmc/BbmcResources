### David Bard Research Summary

#### Problem: 

This program of research explores in depth the pervasiveness, totality of impact, and causal mechanisms that underlie the well-documented relationship between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and the mental and physical health of families and children.  It also examines closely the efficacy and effectiveness of treatments designed to either prevent or mitigate ACEs impact on health.

#### Method: 

A variety of methods are being used to explore the connection between ACEs and health, including epidemiologic surveys identifying health disparities in high ACE neighborhoods and communities, quasi-experimental and randomized field trials examining the effectiveness of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention programs, and secondary analyses of large datasets of health-related outcomes for high-risk families and children. 
Contribution to the Science:
This cluster of studies examines closer the full gamut of ACEs that impact health and includes work aimed at building better predictive models for identifying future ACE and health risks, comparative efficacy of health promotion and ACE prevention programs, and theoretical work investigating the relationship between genes and ACEs effect on health.  

#### Practical Impact on Child Health:

Most of the work underway approaches the problem of ACEs and downstream health outcomes from a public health perspective with practical implications that largely overlap with work on health disparities and flattening the social-economic gradient in health.  Findings from this research program are intended to better describe the magnitude of the problem and identify, as well as rule-out, potential treatments for lowering ACEs risks and building protective factors that help moderate ACEs impact on health.  Several studies have adopted an implementation science perspective and focus on improving program outcomes and efficiencies through better systems integration, data-informed triage of families to optimal personalized treatments, identification of Best Practices guidelines, and impact of method of training on long-term program sustainability. 

#### Funding Agencies:

The work to date has been funded through various sources including the National Institutes of Health, Health Resources and Services Administration, the Administration for Children and Families, as well as several other local State government and community-level agencies.
