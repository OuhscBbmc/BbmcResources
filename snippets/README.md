Snippets
=======================

I want this mostly to be a bank of material that's quick to review, and quick to extract language to save time when assembling a grant proposal or describing a research investigation.

Although this is public and theoretically anyone can read it, don't expect any important information to be found by outsiders.  Put that in something like the [BBMC webpage](http://www.ouhsc.edu/bbmc/) or a project-specific webpage (eg, http://ouhscbbmc.github.io/MReportingPublic/)

This directory will have a subdirectory for each year.  Then each year's directory will have a dated text/markdown file.  Examples are `2015-05-ccan-capabilities.md` and `2015-06-database-and-reporting.md`.

Each nonminor change to the library should produce its own snippet file.  I don’t think anyone should try to revise old versions in-place.  I think that’s a good balance between (a) a light-weight system that doesn’t take any time to maintain old copies and (b) an accessible collection of snippets to review when we’re looking for something to give a jump start for a proposal or manuscript.
